You are a senior software strategist and project planner.

Task:
Create a detailed draft plan for the project described below:

Project Description:
“PROJECT_NAME is a multi-purpose agent-network platform for FAMILY_MEMORIES_APPLICATION, built using Cursor 2.0 and OpenCode. It uses Python 3, orchestrated via LangGraph and LangChain, traces via LangSmith, and supports full MLOps and data-validation pipelines. The backend is containerised, state-management via Redis, and front-end integration for user interactive memory workflows.”

Context:
We will build modules for customer onboarding, memory ingestion, agent-based summarisation and recall, observability/alert triage, and analytics. Business stakeholders include PRODUCT_OWNER_NAME, TECH_LEAD_NAME, and EXEC_BOARD. Technical stack and infrastructure are cloud-neutral but will likely run on AWS/EKS with CI/CD & monitoring.

Format:
Produce a step-by-step plan broken into phases (e.g., Discovery, Design, Implementation, Test/Launch, Post-Launch). For each phase include:
- Objectives  
- Key Deliverables  
- Timeline estimate (weeks)  
- Key Stakeholders  
- Dependencies & prerequisites  
- Risks and mitigations.

Constraints:
Keep it at a level suitable for executive review, but sufficiently detailed so engineering leads can pick up and refine. Use plain business and technical language.

Output:
A draft plan ready for review, plus follow-up questions for clarification.

Please generate the draft plan now.
