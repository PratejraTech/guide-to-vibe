You are a lead product manager collaborating with engineering and architecture teams.

Task:
Draft the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for PROJECT_NAME, aligning to the folder structure we have defined.

Context:
Platform for FAMILY_MEMORIES_APPLICATION – multi-purpose agent network built with Cursor 2.0 and OpenCode, Python3 backend, LangGraph routing, Redis state-machine, containerised microservices, data lake, MLOps, observability. The product serves consumer users (families) and internal users (customer support, analytics team). Key business objectives: user engagement, memory recall accuracy, alert-triage reduction, scalability for high user volume, maintainable platform.

Format:
Structure the PRD with the following sections:
- Executive Summary  
- Scope & Objectives  
- Features & Capabilities (list key features)  
- User Journeys & Personas  
- Functional Requirements (for each module/folder reference)  
- Non-Functional Requirements (performance, scalability, security, observability)  
- Data Requirements & Validation  
- Agent Workflow & Routing Logic  
- Integration & API Requirements  
- Deployment & Monitoring Requirements  
- Acceptance Criteria & Metrics  
- Dependencies & Risks  

For each feature, clearly reference the folder or module (from our folder structure) that will implement it. Use language understandable to both product and engineering teams. Include high-level acceptance criteria (not yet detailed test scripts).

Constraints:
Keep it thorough but readable. Use placeholders for PROJECT_NAME, MODULE_NAME, USER_TYPE, etc.

Output:
Complete PRD ready for stakeholder review. At end, ask for additional stakeholder or requirement details missing.
