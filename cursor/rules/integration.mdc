# integration.mdc — Integration & E2E Build Specification

This document governs all cross-cutting concerns and integration activities, referencing:

- The Integration Playbook (`07-integration.md`)
- The canonical structure (`folders.mdc`)
- Backend + Frontend module specifications

No integration-level decisions may modify structure independently.

---

## 1. Responsibilities

- Frontend ↔ Backend API contract  
- End-to-end signal propagation  
- Agent network integration  
- Error funnels and observability  
- Cross-layer testing (E2E suite)

---

## 2. Integration Phases (From Playbook 07)

1. **Phase 1 — Interface Definition**
2. **Phase 2 — Contract Stabilisation**
3. **Phase 3 — Full Integration**
4. **Phase 4 — E2E Validation & Release Readiness**

---

## 3. Testing Requirements

- E2E tests for all user-critical flows  
- Contract tests for API interfaces  
- Regression matrix for multi-phase builds  

---

## 4. Constraints

- Must follow folders.mdc  
- Cannot change backend or frontend without updating their MDCs and architecture notes  
- Integration failures must be logged in documentation
