# documentation.mdc — Documentation Extraction & Generation Protocol

This MDC defines how agents must systematically **review the entire repository**, extract **clear production-ready features & functionality**, and generate **MDX documentation** into the `/docs/` hierarchy.

This process runs as a **separate job**, triggered manually or as part of the “Documentation Sweep” workflow.  
It is intended to produce **accurate, stable, traceable technical documentation** for internal and external readers.

Documentation must *never* contradict:
- `.cursorrules`
- `.agents/folders.mdc` (source of truth for structure)
- PRD
- Architecture docs
- Backend/Frontend/Integration MDCs

---

## 1. Purpose

The goal of this protocol is to:

1. Ensure documentation reflects the **actual state of the repository**.  
2. Extract **features, behaviors, APIs, schemas, components, flows** from the existing codebase.  
3. Write structured MDX documents under `docs/` organized by directory.  
4. Bridge the gap between:
   - PRD intent  
   - Architecture design  
   - Real implementation  
5. Provide a reference for onboarding, audits, agent reliability, and maintainers.

This job should be run **before major releases**, and **after significant refactors**.

## 2. Scope of the Documentation Sweep

The documentation sweep MUST produce:

### 2.1 Code-First Documentation
A tree-by-tree extraction of:

- Modules  
- Classes  
- Functions  
- Components  
- Routes  
- API endpoints  
- Services  
- Schemas  
- Utilities  
- Jobs/workers  
- Integration surfaces  
- Errors & validation rules  

### 2.2 Feature & Behavior Documentation
For each directory:

- What features does it implement?  
- How do those features align with the PRD?  
- What behaviors are guaranteed?  
- What assumptions exist?  
- What test coverage exists?  
- What are the internal/external contracts?  

### 2.3 Directory-Aligned MDX Files
Each directory gets a corresponding MDX file under:
